Tech Stack

We use Babel to transpile ES6 and JSX code. For development purposes, we recommend using an in-browser transpiler offered by a CDN. But for production, we recommend precompiling your code prior to deploying.

####Front-End:
ReactJS
React-Router
jQuery
Materialize CSS

####Back-End:
Node.js
Express
Socket.io
MongoDB
Mongoose (ODM)

####Utilities:
Webpack -- javascript file bundling (please read this Webpack tutorial by one of React's lead engineers, Pete Hunt, espousing the benefits of Webpack within the React workflow. https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto)
Grunt / Gulp / Shell Files for ease-of-build

####Further Notes:
Please .gitignore your node_modules and bower_components. We do not want to clutter our repo. This will bottleneck the download/upload processes.
